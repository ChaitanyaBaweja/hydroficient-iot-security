## 1. What We Added

[Write one paragraph explaining what you added to the security system in plain language. What does the AI layer do? How does it work alongside the existing rule-based defenses? Avoid technical jargon — Marcus is a property manager, not an engineer.]


## 2. What It Detected

[Write 2-3 sentences describing the types of anomalies the AI caught during testing. What specific patterns did it flag? Reference the types you saw on the dashboard — abnormal pressure, unexpected flow changes, etc.]


## 3. False Positive Analysis

[Write 2-3 sentences about the model's accuracy. How often did it flag normal data as suspicious? Reference your precision score from Step 2. Is this false alarm rate acceptable for the Grand Marina's operations team?]


## 4. Limitations

The AI layer has the following limitations:

- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]
- [Limitation 3]
- [Add more if relevant]


## 5. Recommendation

[Write 2-3 sentences. Should the Grand Marina keep the AI layer running? Under what conditions? What should the operations team do when they see an orange alert on the dashboard?]
